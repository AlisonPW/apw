            As a highly creative artist, I have advanced skills in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom, and Fresco. I'm proficient on both Mac
            and PC platforms, and I also have experience with Adobe After Effects, and Visual Studio Code. I'm currently refreshing
            my knowledge of web design and development, and I thrive on transforming concepts into visually compelling outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
            I work as a freelance designer, creating print and social media projects for small organizations and individuals throughout Arizona. Previously,
            I was a production team member at the Maricopa Institute for Arts and Entertainment Technology (MIAET) / MCTV, where I delivered high-quality graphics
            for print, web, broadcast, and 3D animation under tight deadlines. One of my proudest achievements was art directing the branding for the 20th
            Annual Southwest Film and Video Festival.
            </p>
            <p>
            In addition to my design work, I’ve contributed to education by assistant teaching Adobe program fundamentals and graphic design to high school
            students at the Metropolitan Arts Institute in Downtown Phoenix, AZ. I also managed the yearbook club and served as a Graphic Design Computer Lab assistant
            at Scottsdale Community College, providing tutoring and technical support for fellow students.
